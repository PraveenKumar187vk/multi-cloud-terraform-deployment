# Multi-Cloud Auto Deployment using Terraform (AWS + GCP)
This project provisions web servers on AWS EC2 and GCP Compute Engine using Terraform. Both servers run NGINX and respond with a custom message.

## Setup
1. Set your credentials for AWS and GCP.
2. Update `terraform.tfvars` with your key names and project ID.
3. Run:
```
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
```

## Validate
Use curl or a browser to access:
- `http://<aws_public_ip>`
- `http://<gcp_public_ip>`

Use DNSMasq to route based on domain like `aws.local`, `gcp.local`.
